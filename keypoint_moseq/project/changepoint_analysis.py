Changepoint analysis 
 
 Analyze keypoint trajectories to identify whether block structure exists in the data and what the temporal scale for the blocks are.

Methodology
 
 1. Compute a windowed derivative from each changepoint trajectory. 
 2. Use different window sizes: 100ms, 500ms, 1s, 2s and 5s to compute numerical derivatives
 3. z-score the derivative for each keypoint and binarize with a threshold
 4. Compute the number of threshold crossings on each frame and smooth with a Gaussian kernel to get the change score
 5. Find local peaks in the change score

Steps
 
 1. Read coordinates from sleap videos
 2. Flatten the data into frames x keypoint coordinates
 3. WAF a compute the filtered derivative for a given window for each 1D timeseries
 4. z-score and binarize each timeseries
 5. Count the number of threshold crossings for each frame - this is a 1D timeseries
 6. Smooth the changepoint timeseries with a Gaussian kernel

Generating the null-distribution to compute p-values
 
 1. For each experiment take the keypoint trajectories and cyclically permute them by a random interval
 2. Repeat the process of taking the derivative, z-score the derivative, binarize the z-scored derivative over a threshold and count the number of threshold crossings per frame across the different keypoint trajectories
 3. This will yield a distribution of change-scores for each frame.
 4. Compare the real change score for each frame with the change score of the null distribution and compute the p-value.
 5. The final change-score for the frame is -log(pval)
